Okay, let's dive into crafting prompts to generate code from the design images you'll be creating. The key here is to provide the code generation AI with sufficient context about the desired technology, UI framework, and the functionality you want.

**Key Prompting Techniques for Code Generation:**

1.  **Specify the Technology:** Clearly state the language and framework you want to use (e.g., "React," "HTML/CSS/JavaScript," "Vue.js," "SwiftUI").
2.  **Describe the UI:** Briefly describe the layout, the components used, and the general style.
3.  **Mention Placeholders:** Explicitly state that certain elements in the design are placeholders, and you will replace them with actual assets later.
4.  **Request Semantic HTML:** If generating HTML, ask for semantic elements.
5.  **Request Accessible Code:** Mention that accessibility is important (e.g., "ensure accessibility," "add ARIA attributes if needed").
6.  **State Intended Functionality:** Briefly describe the basic interactivity you expect (e.g., "handle button clicks," "update state on input change").
7.  **Ask for Component-Based Structure (if needed):** If using React or Vue.js, ask for a component-based architecture.
8.  **Mention Responsiveness:** Ask for responsive design.

**Example Prompts (based on React, HTML/CSS and UI structure)**

**1. Welcome Page (Code Generation Prompt - React):**

> "Generate React code for a mobile app welcome page based on the provided image. The layout consists of a soft gradient background, a logo placeholder at the top, with placeholder title text and a smaller text as a tagline, and a rounded button placeholder with text. Use component-based structure. The button should have an onClick handler that navigates to the next screen. Use a modern and clean style. The components should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes."

**1. Welcome Page (Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML and CSS code for a mobile app welcome page based on the provided image. Use semantic HTML elements where applicable. The layout consists of a soft gradient background, a logo placeholder at the top, with placeholder title text and a smaller text as a tagline, and a rounded button placeholder with text. Ensure the page is responsive for mobile devices. The button should have a basic link that can be replaced later."

**2. Training Settings Page (Code Generation Prompt - React):**

> "Generate React code for a mobile app's training settings page based on the provided image. Use a vertical layout with clear sections, separated by a horizontal line. Each section should have a bold text title. The 'Training Mode' section uses radio buttons. The 'Reminder Times' section has time dropdown select elements. The 'Repetitions' section contains an input field with plus/minus buttons. The 'Goal Sentences' section contains a text area and an add button and displays a scrollable list with each item including a simple delete button and radio button. The page ends with a large rectangular 'Save Settings' button. All these elements are using placeholder assets. The components should be responsive and use a modern style. All inputs should have the required change handlers."

**2. Training Settings Page (Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML and CSS code for a mobile app's training settings page based on the provided image. Use semantic HTML elements where applicable. The layout is vertical with clear sections separated by horizontal lines. Include radio buttons for Training Mode selection, dropdown inputs for time selection for ‘Reminder Times’. Create a number input with + and - buttons for ‘Repetitions’ and a text input with an ‘Add New Sentence’ button for ‘Goal Sentences’. The elements are using placeholder assets. Add a submit button to save settings. The page should be responsive and use a light color palette."

**3. Training Page (Voice Mode - Code Generation Prompt - React):**

> "Generate React code for the voice mode of the training page based on the provided image. Include a large circle placeholder for the microphone icon in the center, and a round button with a 'Start Recording' text placeholder. A textarea placeholder where the recognized text should be displayed and a progress bar with a placeholder for the progress and text above it and an outlined Submit button at the bottom, all with placeholder assets. The component should handle starting and stopping the recording using the Web Speech API, and update the text area with the recognized text. Use a clean and modern style."

**3. Training Page (Voice Mode - Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML/CSS code for the voice mode of a mobile app's training page based on the provided image. The main elements should be a placeholder for a large circle microphone icon, a 'Start Recording' circular button, a text area for the recognized text, and a simple outline 'Submit' button, and a progress bar. Use a very light gray background, and all assets are placeholders. Add basic functions such as showing text in the text area and progress bar."

**3. Training Page (Drag Mode - Code Generation Prompt - React):**

>"Generate React code for the drag mode of a mobile app training page. Display a drag and drop area where the words of the affirmation can be rearranged, and a progress bar, a submit button, all using placeholder assets. The component should handle drag and drop functionality. Keep the layout responsive and easy to use."

**3. Training Page (Drag Mode - Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML/CSS code for the drag mode of a mobile app training page. The main elements should be a drag area and a drop area, a progress bar and an outlined submit button, all using placeholder assets. Make sure the drag and drop items can be styled separately using a basic CSS."

**3. Training Page (Text Mode - Code Generation Prompt - React):**

> "Generate React code for the text mode of a mobile app training page. Display a multiline text input area, a progress bar and a submit button. The component should handle and store the input and display it. Keep the layout responsive and easy to use. Ensure all elements are placeholders for final assets."

**3. Training Page (Text Mode - Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML and CSS code for the text mode of a mobile app training page. Display a multi-line text input area, a progress bar and a basic submit button, all using placeholder assets. Keep the structure simple and make it responsive."

**4. Result Record Page (Code Generation Prompt - React):**

> "Generate React code for a mobile app's result record page based on the provided image. The component should display a calendar and a list of training records for each selected day. Use a component-based approach with placeholder data. Each training record should have the training time, mode, repetition count and affirmation. The UI should use a modern style, be responsive and accessible."

**4. Result Record Page (Code Generation Prompt - HTML/CSS):**

> "Generate HTML and CSS code for a mobile app's result record page. The layout should include a calendar view and a list of training records, using placeholder data for the record content. Make sure the page is responsive and accessible. Include basic styling for the calendar and list layout."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Code Generation Tools:** Keep in mind the capabilities of the code generation tool you're using. Some might handle complex logic better than others.
*   **Iterative Approach:** Start with a simple prompt, and then gradually refine it based on the generated code. You will likely need to make some manual adjustments.
*   **Modular Code:** If you want to reuse the components and logic, request a modular code structure that is easily extendable and reusable.
*   **Keep It Simple:** The simpler the prompt, the less likely it is the tool will hallucinate something unnecessary.
*   **Focus on the layout:** Try to always emphasis getting the layout right, then you can concentrate on the styling.

By using these techniques, you'll be able to generate code that preserves the layout and structure of your design and allows for easy replacement of assets. This method helps to bridge the gap between visual design and code. Let me know if you need more adjustments or have other aspects you want to cover!
