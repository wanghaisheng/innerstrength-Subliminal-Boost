You are absolutely right! My apologies for the misunderstanding. I now understand that you want to use the screen descriptions to generate *actual design images*, then use these images as input for code generation, while ensuring the generated code preserves the layout and uses placeholders for assets that you can then replace.

This is a clever approach to streamline the design-to-code workflow! Here's how we can refine our approach to support that process:

**Updated Prompting Strategy (for Design Image Generation):**

1.  **Realistic UI Rendering:** Instead of "flat design," we'll ask for more "realistic" or "modern" UI rendering, so we get a design that looks like a real app.
2.  **Specific Layout Details:** Retain precise details about sections, headers, buttons, lists, etc.
3.  **Clear Placeholders (with context):** Instead of just saying "placeholder," we'll say what it's a placeholder *for*, e.g., "a placeholder for a logo icon," "a placeholder for a start button icon," "a placeholder image in the header."
4.  **Simple Placeholder Shapes:** While asking for a more realistic render, the placeholders should be simple, like outlined shapes, solid color rectangles, or circular icons with simple symbols so they are easy to identify when slicing assets.
5.  **Specific Color Palette:** Request a consistent color palette of a light blue, light gray and white (or any colors you choose).
6.  **Readable Text (as Placeholders):** Generate with placeholder texts inside buttons and labels that make sense and are readable.
7.  **Use Real Fonts (or Similar):** Specify that you want similar style of Montserrat or a popular, clean sans-serif font, so we get correct spacing.

**Example Prompts (for Design Image Generation):**

**1. Welcome Page (Design Image):**

> "Generate a modern, realistic UI design image of a mobile app welcome screen. The background should have a subtle gradient from light cyan to white. At the center top, include a circle placeholder outlined in dark gray for a logo icon, above a placeholder title text 'Subliminal Boost' using a sans-serif font. Underneath the title, include a placeholder line of text 'Unlock Your Mind's Potential'. A rounded rectangular button should be in the center with the placeholder text 'Start Training' in white. The overall design should be clean and inviting, with a feeling of possibility."

**2. Training Settings Page (Design Image):**

> "Generate a realistic UI design image of a mobile app's training settings page. Use a vertical scrollable layout, with each section clearly separated by a light gray line. Each section should start with a bold title, with a font style that resembles the Montserrat font. The 'Training Mode' section contains three rounded rectangular buttons side by side, each with a simple gray circle placeholder for an icon, and the text label underneath. The 'Reminder Times' section has dropdowns each with a clock icon placeholder and corresponding text labels: 'Morning,' 'Afternoon,' 'Evening' and ‘Before Sleep’. The 'Repetitions' section shows a number input with plus/minus buttons. The 'Goal Sentences' section contains a rectangular text input field with placeholder text, an ‘Add New Sentence’ button and a scrollable list of items. Each item should have placeholder text, a simple gray rectangle for a pencil icon, a simple gray rectangle for a trash icon, and an outline circle placeholder for the radio button, with a clear indication of the currently selected default. There should be a large, rounded rectangular button with the placeholder text ‘Save Settings’ at the bottom. Use a light grey and light blue consistent palette."

**3. Training Page (Voice Mode - Design Image):**

> "Generate a modern UI design image for the Voice Mode of a mobile app training page. The background is a very light gray. In the center of the page, there should be a large, outlined circle placeholder with a simple gray microphone symbol for a microphone icon. Below is a circular button with the text ‘Start Recording’ in white. Below it is a placeholder area with a light grey border that will be used to display recognized text. There should be a progress bar at the bottom of the text area, and a clear button at the bottom of the page, with the text ‘Submit’ in white. The UI should be clear, focused, and modern."

**3. Training Page (Drag Mode - Design Image):**

> "Generate a realistic UI design image for the Drag Mode of a mobile app training page. The background is very light gray. There should be a clear drop area with a light grey dotted line. This drop area has several rectangular placeholders for the words of the affirmation. Also, make sure the text affirmation should be represented as rounded rectangles with a light gray border. Add a progress bar and a submit button at the bottom of the page. Ensure the design is modern and easy to use."

**3. Training Page (Text Mode - Design Image):**

> "Generate a modern UI design image for the Text Mode of a mobile app training page. The background should be a light grey. In the middle of the page, include a large multi-line text input area, with a light grey border and the placeholder text "Type your affirmation here". Add a progress bar and a submit button at the bottom of the page. The design should look clean and focused."

**4. Result Record Page (Design Image):**

> "Generate a realistic UI design image of a mobile app's result record page. Include a simple calendar with clearly marked dates, use light gray for weekends and a subtle blue color to highlight today's date. The day selected on the calendar should be highlighted with a light-blue circle. Below the calendar, include placeholders for a list of training records, each with the date, a bold text time, the training mode label, a number of repetition and the used affirmation."

**How to Use the Generated Design Images:**

1.  **Generate Images:** Use the prompts above (or similar) with your image generation tool.
2.  **Slice Assets:** Use a graphic editing tool to slice out the various UI elements, logos, buttons, etc. This is easier to do when the placeholders are simple.
3.  **Code Generation:** Feed the full design image to your code generation tool.
4.  **Replace Placeholders:** In the generated code, replace the placeholder elements with your actual sliced assets.

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Realistic Designs:** Generate real designs with a modern UI.
*   **Clear Placeholders:** The placeholders for assets are clear, which makes it easy to extract assets and integrate them into your code.
*   **Layout Preservation:** The generated code should retain the layout and structure from the design image.
*   **Faster Iteration:** This approach speeds up the design-to-code workflow by automating parts of the process.

By using these techniques, you will be able to generate high-quality design images that are ready for code generation and asset integration.
