You are absolutely right! My apologies for misunderstanding. You're planning to use the generated image not as a placeholder guide, but as the source for cutting assets and feeding the *complete* design to a code generation tool. This makes more sense for a seamless workflow.

So, let's refine our prompts to generate images that are suitable for both asset extraction and code generation. This requires generating higher fidelity images with more visual detail and precision.

**Refined Prompting Strategy for Asset Extraction & Code Generation:**

1.  **Detailed Layout Descriptions:** Use the detailed layout descriptions from our earlier responses, including specific fonts, colors, spacing, and visual elements.
2.  **Consistent Visual Style:** Maintain a consistent color scheme, typography, and design language.
3.  **Request Realistic Mockup:** Instead of "wireframe" or "flat design," use terms like "realistic UI mockup," "high-fidelity mock," or "detailed screen design."
4.  **Clear Element Boundaries:** Ensure clear boundaries for each UI element, making them easy to isolate and extract.
5.  **Specific Size & Spacing:** Request sizes and spacing in pixel or point units when possible.
6.  **Use Real or Placeholder Text:** Add real text where possible to provide a realistic context.
7.  **Avoid Overly Complex Graphics:** Keep complex patterns or graphics minimal, as they are harder to isolate and may introduce noise for the code generation.

**Example Prompts (Reflecting Full Design):**

**1. Welcome Page (Full Design Prompt):**

> "Generate a high-fidelity UI mockup of a mobile app welcome page. The background has a soft gradient from light cyan (#E0FFFF) to white (#FFFFFF). At the center top, include a stylized outline icon of a blooming flower above the text title 'Subliminal Boost' using the Montserrat font (semi-bold, 32pt) in dark gray (#333333). Underneath, display the tagline 'Unlock Your Mind's Potential' in Montserrat font (regular, 16pt) in medium grey (#666666). In the center, there is a large, rounded rectangle button (8px radius) with sky-blue (#87CEEB) background and the text 'Begin Your Journey' (Montserrat font, medium, 18pt) in white (#FFFFFF). Use a clean, minimalist design."

**2. Training Settings Page (Full Design Prompt):**

> "Generate a detailed UI mockup of a mobile app's Training Settings page. The page is scrollable, with sections separated by thin (1px) light-grey lines. Each section has a header (Montserrat bold, 20pt) in dark gray (#333333). The 'Training Mode' section displays three rounded buttons (4px radius) in a horizontal row with a Vibrant Yellow background (#FFD700) for the selected one. These contain icons of a microphone, a drag handle, and a text bubble for each mode (unselected ones should be transparent). The 'Reminder Times' section has labels in medium-grey (#666666), a time picker, and a clock icon for each. Include a numeric input (4px border radius) with + and - buttons for setting Repetitions. 'Goal Sentences' includes a bordered textarea (1px light-grey border), an 'Add New Sentence' button (light-green with a "+" symbol), and below a list of the added sentences each with 'Edit' (pencil icon) and 'Delete' (trash icon) buttons and a radio button, to select as default. A large rounded sky-blue (8px radius) button with white 'Save Settings' (Montserrat, medium 18pt) text at the bottom. Use a light background."

**3. Training Page (Voice Mode - Full Design Prompt):**

> "Create a realistic UI mockup of a mobile app training page in Voice Mode. The background is light grey (#F0F0F0). The center has a large, stylized microphone icon (bold, dark grey #333333). Directly below it is a circular button with a light-sky-blue background (#B0E0E6), labeled 'Start Recording' in Montserrat white (18pt).  The text area for recognized text has a light gray border and placeholder text. A progress bar tracks repetitions. At the bottom, a rounded sky-blue (8px radius) button labeled 'Submit' with white (18pt, Montserrat) text. Use subtle shadows for better visual separation."

**3. Training Page (Drag Mode - Full Design Prompt):**

> "Generate a detailed UI mockup of a mobile app's training page in Drag Mode. The background is light grey (#F0F0F0). Show a clearly defined area with randomly arranged rectangular blocks having a 6px border radius, light-grey borders and Montserrat placeholder text. The drop area is marked with dotted lines and subtle indicators for block placement. Include a progress bar. The 'Submit' button is at the bottom, a rounded sky-blue (8px radius) button with white text (18pt, Montserrat). Use clear boundaries and simple colors."

**3. Training Page (Text Mode - Full Design Prompt):**

> "Create a detailed screen design for the mobile app's training page in Text Mode. Use a light grey (#F0F0F0) background. The page features a large, multi-line text input area with a light-gray border and placeholder text 'Type your affirmation here' using the Montserrat font.  Include a progress bar and a rounded sky-blue (8px radius) button labeled 'Submit' with white text (18pt, Montserrat) at the bottom. Ensure clear visual spacing and boundaries."

**4. Result Record Page (Full Design Prompt):**

> "Generate a high-fidelity mockup for the mobile app's Result Record page. The page includes a monthly calendar at the top, with a light-blue circle indicating the currently selected day. Below the calendar, display training records in a list format using a white rounded rectangle (8px radius) with a light-gray top border. Each record contains the training time, mode, repetitions, and sentence used in a clear, readable font (Montserrat). Include appropriate labels for each data point. Use clean lines, a simple layout, and a neutral color scheme."

**Key Considerations for Asset Extraction and Code Generation:**

1.  **Image Resolution:** Ensure the generated image has high resolution so that extracted assets and code generation will be detailed and precise.
2.  **Element Spacing:** Pay extra attention to spacing, ensuring enough padding between elements for a clean layout.
3.  **Clear Colors:** Use easily distinguishable colors for different UI elements.
4.  **No Background Clutter:** Keep background elements simple, and not distracting from the UI elements.
5.  **Consistent Typography:** Stick to one or two specific fonts with variations (e.g., bold, regular, light) for text in the whole image.

**After Image Generation:**

1.  **Extract Assets:** Use image editing software to cut out each individual icon, image, or graphical element (buttons, text inputs etc) from the generated images.
2.  **Code Generation:** Feed the *whole design image* to a suitable code generation tool that can interpret the design. This will help you get a more complete and precise code.
3.  **Adjust as Needed:** You may need to adjust some layout details or coding output from the code generation tool.

By using these refined prompts, you'll generate high-quality, detailed UI mockups that are ideal for both asset extraction and code generation workflows. The key is to be explicit about the visual details and specific UI elements. Let me know if you have more questions or need any further adjustments!
